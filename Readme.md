# Repaint Face #
## Sketchup Extension ##

*If you just want to install the extensions, you're in the wrong place.*  Choose `window | extension warehouse` from the Sketchup menu.  Search the warehouse for **Repaint Face**, and install like any other plugin.  This is just the location to store and share the source code.
